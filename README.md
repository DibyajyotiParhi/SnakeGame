# SnakeGame
This Snake game allows players to control a snake using the arrow keys on their keyboard. The objective is to guide the snake to eat the food (green square) while avoiding collision with the walls and the snake itself. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

Excercises :

- How do you make the snake faster or slower?
- How can you make the snake go around the edges?
- How would you move the food?
- Change the snake to respond to arrow keys.
